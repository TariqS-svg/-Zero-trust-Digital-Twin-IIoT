Project Title:
Zero Trust–Enhanced Digital Twin Security for Industrial IoT
Description:
This project presents a security framework for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments by integrating Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), Federated Learning (FL), and Digital Twin concepts. The goal is to continuously verify device behavior, detect intrusions in a privacy-preserving manner, and reflect the real-time security posture through a digital twin representation.
The framework is designed for academic research and experimental evaluation of modern IIoT security challenges, including insider threats, adversarial attacks, and data privacy concerns.
Key Features:
•	Dynamic trust scoring based on Zero Trust principles
•	Federated Learning for decentralized intrusion detection
•	Privacy preservation using Differential Privacy concepts
•	Simulation of adversarial and normal operating conditions
•	Digital Twin–style visualization of device security states
Intended Use:
•	Academic research
•	Master’s / PhD projects
•	Security experimentation in IIoT environments
Documentation:
•	Environment setup details: docs/Environment_Setup.md
•	Dataset description and structure: docs/Associated_Data.md

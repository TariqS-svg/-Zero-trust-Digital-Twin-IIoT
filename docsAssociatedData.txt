Purpose:
This document describes the datasets associated with the Zero Trust–Enhanced Digital Twin Security for Industrial IoT project, including their role in the experimental workflow and expected structure.

1. Datasets Overview
The framework is designed to work with publicly available intrusion detection datasets commonly used in IIoT and cybersecurity research, such as:
•	NSL-KDD
•	CICIDS-2017
•	IoT-23
•	TON_IoT
These datasets contain network traffic and system activity records labeled as normal or malicious behavior.

2. Data Usage in the Project
The datasets are used to:
•	Train intrusion detection models
•	Simulate federated learning clients
•	Evaluate detection accuracy under normal conditions
•	Assess robustness under adversarial and insider attack scenarios

3. Expected Data Structure
Each dataset is expected to include:
•	Multiple feature columns representing network or system behavior
•	One target column indicating the class or attack type
Typical classes include:
•	Normal
•	Denial of Service (DoS)
•	Probe
•	Remote to Local (R2L)
•	User to Root (U2R)

4. Preprocessing Assumptions
Before training, datasets typically undergo:
•	Data cleaning and normalization
•	Feature scaling
•	Optional class balancing techniques
•	Optional noise injection for privacy preservation
These steps support realistic simulation of federated and privacy-aware learning.

5. Federated Learning Simulation
For federated learning experiments:
•	Data is split across multiple simulated clients
•	Each client trains a local model
•	Model updates are aggregated centrally without sharing raw data
This approach aligns with Zero Trust and privacy-by-design principles.

6. Experimental Outputs
The project may generate:
•	Performance metrics such as accuracy and latency
•	Confusion matrices and ROC curves
•	Trust score logs for each device
•	Digital Twin visual representations showing device states (e.g., trusted, suspicious, quarantined)

7. Data Availability Note
Datasets are not included in the GitHub repository due to size and licensing constraints.
Users must download datasets from their original sources and place them in the appropriate local directory

Purpose:
This document describes the recommended environment configuration required to run the Zero Trust–Enhanced Digital Twin Security project.
System Requirements:
•	Python version 3.9 or later
•	Operating system: Windows, Linux, or macOS
•	Minimum 8 GB RAM (16 GB recommended for large datasets)
•	Optional GPU support for deep learning experiments
Python Libraries:
The project relies on standard data science and machine learning libraries such as:
•	Numerical and data processing libraries
•	Machine learning and deep learning frameworks
•	Visualization and explainability tools
All required libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file.
Execution Environment Notes:
•	The project can be executed locally or on cloud platforms such as Google Colab.
•	For cloud execution, dataset paths may need adjustment.
•	GPU acceleration is optional but recommended for faster training.
Reproducibility Guidelines:
•	Use fixed random seeds where possible
•	Maintain consistent dataset versions
•	Document any configuration changes during experiments
